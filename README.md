# [LSTM-RNN] Sentiment Analysis (SentiMeter)

*********************** Sentimeter *********************

Sentimeter is designed to analyze the semantic of a sentence to conclude whether it has a positive sentiment or negative. The model includes LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), which is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). The model is trained with 1.5 million tweets and thanks to Kaggle, which is a go-to platform when it comes to big-data and ML. And also thanks to Kaggle for providing free TPU service because even GPU is a time-consuming option with such big-data. ‚ù§Ô∏è

The concept is simple if the machine senses the positive sentiment in the sentence it will thumbs-up üëç, and for negative sentiment thumbs-down üëé.

The program has good accuracy to sense the semantic of the sentence as the last two sentences in the video could be challenging for the program to understand, but it made the right guess.

1) Food was good, and not bad at all.

2) Food was bad, and not good at all.

Achieved Accuracy: 82.67\%

Parameter Trained: More than 2.3 million
